The 2006 vintage showcases fruit from two of the state's premiere sites for Cabernet—Horse Heaven Hills and Wahluke Slope, where the desert-like conditions of very warm days, cool nights and drying winds allow the grapes to fully ripen with little threat from disease. Classic Cabernet flavors of cassis, berry and plum mingle harmoniously with light oak spice and an understated sage note.

The name Melbury is in homage to an historic area in London, where the estate owners reside much of the year. Since its debut with the 1999 vintage, the consistent hallmarks of Melbury have been plush red fruits (currants, bing cherries), redolent with spice and the scent of violets. Elegance and a supple texture define the structure of this wine. The particular exposition of this rocky 7-acre hillside vineyard is southerly overlooking Lake Hennessey, allowing the vines to capture the morning sun yet moderating afternoon temperatures."
Jeff Cohn Cellars Landy Sweetwater Springs Zinfandel 2011,"Russian River, Sonoma County, California",Red Wine,92,"This year it shows a ton of sweet red and black raspberry notes, roasted Herbs de Provence with just a touch of charcuterie and roasted earth notes on both the aromatics and palate. This wine has a very silky texture, but with ripe tannins that will allow one to age this wine for some time."
Le Macchiole Paleo (3 Liter Bottle) 2011,"Tuscany, Italy",Red Wine,92,"Named for the local wild grass that once covered its vineyards, Paleo Rosso is a landmark expression of Italian CabernetFranc.

The nose is lifted, ripe and forward showing generous plummy Shiraz notes with plenty of complementary oak. The palate is big and full, with rich lingering Shiraz flavors such as spice, plums and berry fruits.  The structure is solid and complete with the young tannins providing a great backbone to the palate. The wine was aged in a combination of French (60%) and American oak - 80% hogsheads and 20% barriques.  78% of the barrels were new and the remainder had been used once before.

Cantina Cortaccia Pinot Grigio 2012,"Trentino-Alto Adige, Italy",White Wine,89,"This Pinot Grigio gets fine mineral-rich spice that sometimes takes on a fiery varietal perfume of gooseberries, linden flowers, and acacia blossoms from the lime-rich soils of the fantastically steep slopes of Kurtatsch-Penon. The blending of mountain and valley grapes creates an extraordinary Pinot Grigio, with the total class and creamy suppleness of the south and the seriousness on the palate of the north. "
Delectus Cuvee Julia 2004,"Knights Valley, Sonoma County, California",Red Wine,93,"What's the best kept secret in the Napa Valley? It's the fact that only one other person besides winemaker Gerhard Reisacher knows the exact blend components of this amazing wine. Whispered to daughter Julia while deeply asleep, the secret blend melts away into her dreams. This is Cuvée Julia, the crown jewel in the Delectus portfolio of wines. Cuvée Julia is a blend of the best barrels of the vintage, usually Cabernet driven, and is always the most dramatic bottling of the year."
Arrowood Merlot 1995,"Sonoma County, California",Red Wine,90,"On the palate, the 1995 Merlot has incredibly concentrated flavors of black cherry, anise and clove spice. There are hints of plum and violet, with a citrus oil and cedar top note.

Chateau d'Esclans Les Clans Rose 2013,"Cotes de Provence, Provence, South of France, France",Pink and Rosé,91,Les Clans is the first of the higher end cuvees and marks a major departure in the flight as well as the way Rose typically tastes.

Didier Dagueneau Blanc Fume de Pouilly Silex 2011,"Pouilly-Fume, Loire, France",White Wine,93,"This is considered to be Dagueneau's ""Grand Cru"", if you will. The incremental changes made in both the winery and vineyards over the years and more recently by Benjamin Dagueneau have come together with a vintage that could best express what he was trying to say.  Aromatic ripeness without high alcohol.  Massive mineral concentration that will yield over time and marry perfectly with the high-toned fruit components and barrel and bottle complexity that seem in perfect harmony.  The most young and backward of the bunch (as usual), this wine has massive acidity that provides the perfect balance to the mineral profile that is so prevalent in the mouth.  No shortage of fruit, but for the time being, this wine is all about structure and potential.  Sit back and marvel at what the years have in store for this wine, and make sure you save some."
Chateau Magdelaine 1999,"St. Emilion, Bordeaux, France",Red Wine,88,"""The dark ruby-colored 1999 Magdelaine is a stylish, light to medium-bodied effort.

It tastes like a top-notch Beaujolais on steroids. Drink it over the next 2-3 years. This debut offering from Artazuri, a project of Juan-Carlos Lopez de la Call, the force behind Rioja's great Bodegas Artadi, is worth buying by the case."""
Failla Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir 2010,"Sonoma County, California",Red Wine,97,"Aromatics of the Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir 2010 are quintessential Hirsch; expressive with raspberry, green tea, sandalwood and balsam.

Soon afterwards, traces of les Crupots if not les Rochelles can be detected. The wine now shows its full complexity, with aromas of nougat, orange, white flowers and acacia honey.

It is designed to be enjoyed younger but will age for several years."
Foxglove Zinfandel 2015,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California",Red Wine,90,"Brambly, ripe Zinfandel fruit and spice in a fresh package. The use of stainless on the Foxglove Zin keeps the ripe fruit from being too dark. With a slight chill this is an excellent BBQ wine! "

It is world class in complexity, richness and aging potential. Dark ruby/purple with an extraordinary nose of forest floor, spring flowers, plums, black currants and sweet cherries. The wine is full bodied, very rich and quite tannic. The tannins are balanced by the cascade of fruit as well as the pure opulence and richness of the wine.

Kinsella Estates Heirloom Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon 2014,"Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma County, California",Red Wine,96,"While it was the third consecutive year marked by limited rainfall, the 2014 vintage offered a perfectly temperate growing season characterized by long, moderate days and cool, clear nights. The year began with warm spring conditions that gave way to an early bud break and the consistent, dry weather afforded an optimal fruit set of small berries with incredible concentration. Crop yields were down a bit from 2013, but the quality was magnificent. It was a textbook growing season, every winemaker’s dream."
Bodegas Luzon Verde 2009,"Jumilla, Spain",Red Wine,88,The color is deep cherry with a violet rim.

The first, which is to the left of the Clos des Perrières, has clay/limestone soil and a subsoil of volcanic rock which allows a healthy root system to develop in this limestone-rich environment. The second is on the upper slope and overlooks the Perrières quarry. Here the soil is heavily limestone, partly as marl and partly as white rock. This is interesting for the way it brings mineral notes to the wine. "
Iron Horse Estate Chardonnay 2003,"Russian River, Sonoma County, California",White Wine,91,"2003 is a excellent vintage in terms of quality and flavor intensity. It is also a special anniversary vintage, marking our 25th year of making  Estate Chardonnay at Iron Horse. It beautifully expresses the bright,  focused, clean, sweet-tart flavors of cool, foggy Green Valley. It is beautifully balanced, imparting a delightful ""leesy"", toasty,  perfectly integrated barrel character that doesn't overwhelm the fruit. The texture is soft, smooth, silky and sensuous. The finish, long and lingering."

Round and smooth on the attack, it asserts a fine texture over nicely rounded, well-integrated tannins, developing a stylish mid-palate on toasted, roasted notes of caramel, biscuit, spice and chocolate.

J. Lohr Signature Cabernet Sauvignon 2015,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California",Red Wine,95,"Beck Vineyard, in the Creston District of Paso Robles, is a unique site. It sits at 1,700 feet above the early morning fog. Its calcareous soils and cooling afternoon winds are perfect for growing Cabernet Sauvignon. The Cabernet from this vineyard ripens early with excellent color, purity of fruit, and phenolic maturity. Malbec is an ideal addition to the blend, as it complements the fruit component of the savory '15 Cabernet Sauvignon. It also supplies a gain in color without adding more tannins. "
Artesa Napa Merlot 1999,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,88,"This wine offers a wealth of ripe black cherry and plum aromas with mouthwatering hints of warm roasted grain and fresh mint in the background.

This wine has extraordinary aging potential--more than forty years in outstanding vintages."
Eyrie Estate Chardonnay 2017,"Dundee Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon",White Wine,92,"The Chardonnay estate is a barrel selection. Since each barrel ferments with its own yeast and ages at its own rate, each barrel becomes very distinct. Before bottling, the winemaker tastes each barrel. Those barrels which speak to the longest aging potential become the Original Vines Reserve. This estate, on the other hand, is blended from those barrels which offer the most immediate pleasure."
Hermann J. Wiemer Dry Riesling Reserve 2015,"Finger Lakes, New York, Other U.S.",White Wine,91,"The finest qualities of the estate are expressed in their Reserve Dry Riesling, an exclusive wine spotlighting unique characteristics from all three of our vineyard sites.

Lake Sonoma Winery Russian River Chardonnay 2013,"Russian River, Sonoma County, California",White Wine,90,"Its cool climate, sculpted by the regular intrusion of Pacific Coast fog that ebbs and flows through the Petaluma Wind Gap and up the Russian River, makes Russian River Valley one of the world’s most celebrated Chardonnay growing regions. This natural air-conditioning allows Lake Sonoma's Chardonnay grapes to develop full flavor over an extended growing season while retaining their life-giving natural acidity. The result is a Chardonnay of both character and depth."
Fattoria Le Pupille Elisabetta Geppetti Saffredi 1995,"Tuscany, Italy",Red Wine,90,"Saffredi is born in 1987 from the vineyard planted around Magliano 7 years before, by Elisabetta’s mentor, Fredi, and his dear friend Giacomo Tachis.

Carmel Limited Edition (OU Kosher) 2014,Israel,Red Wine,90,"The wine displays a deep purplish hue and is characterized by a hint of ripe plum, cassis, violets mint and cigar boxes.

Gaja Rennina Brunello di Montalcino 2008,"Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",Red Wine,91,"The designation Rennina (rehn-NEE-nah) first appears in the High Middle Ages and is derived from the late-Roman name of the estate, Fundus Rescianum, denoting a state-owned farm. Since the Gaja family's acquisition of the historic estate in 1994, three growing sites have been devoted to the cultivation of Sangiovese grapes for the production of Brunello di Montalcino: Santo Pietro (St. Peter), Castagno (Chestnut Tree), and Pian dei Cerri (Turkish Oak Flats). Here, lime-rich subsoils, southwest exposure, and ventilation arriving from the Tyrrhenian sea to the west deliver well-balanced Brunello di Montalcino, defined by its characteristic red fruit notes, minerality, and polished tannins."
Hacienda Araucano Syrah 2009,Chile,Red Wine,90,"Great depth of color with various shades of purple. A spicy wine, showing aromas of white pepper, liquorice and black cherry.  A supple, elegant and long wine, the spices found on the nose linger on in the form of retronasal sensations.  A real cool-climate Syrah."
Barco de Piedra Tempranillo 2012,"Ribera del Duero, Spain",Red Wine,90,"The grape's thick skin naturally produces powerful, robust wines packed with flavor. Adding more power and oak to something already powerful is overkill. The three parcels that produce Barco de Piedra are located on the hillside of the Quiñón Estate. Raspberry and violet aromas with rose petal, blueberry and mineral notes make this wine. Barco de Piedra is one of the prettiest examples of the elegance and structure of Ribera del Duero, one of the great wine regions of the world."
Conundrum White Blend 2007,California,White Wine,88,"Our wine's core profile remains thoroughly Californian, with Sauvignon Blanc grapes from the Napa Valley, Muscat Canelli from Tulare county on the Central Coast, and Chardonnay and Viognier from our vineyards in Monterey County. The ""puzzle"" of Conundrum lies partly in guessing the range of grape varieties we use, because we never reveal its exact composition."

Colgin IX Estate Red 2016,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,97,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, IX Estate Red is distinguished by complex fruit interplays, a luscious nose of rustic herbs, iron, clay and black fruits, huge layers of flavor and supple, sweet tannins impeccably well-balanced. The number IX refers to the parcel number and is also significant as the date Ann and Joe were married: 9/9. The 2002 vintage was the first, of four vintages, from this property to achieve the highest accolade of “a perfect wine”. Each year the blend displays extraordinary intensity, a beautiful purity, and a remarkably long finish. Approachable when young, it ages most gracefully."
L'Ecole 41 Chardonnay 2005,"Columbia Valley, Washington",White Wine,90,"""Some of the best Chardonnays in Washington State are grown in the slightly cooler growing conditions of Yakima Valley and in the northern latitudes of the Columbia Valley.   Fair Acre Vineyard (Yakima Valley) provides ripe tropical fruit, while Evergreen (latitude 47 on the Columbia River) contributes crisp acidity and minerality.  The old vines at the warmer Sagemoor Vineyard provide a nuance of ripe melon and pear on this Burgundian style Chardonnay."""
Doubleback Cabernet Sauvignon 2014,"Walla Walla Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,92,"A beautifully dark and saturated color that leads in to aromatics of raspberry, blackberry cobbler and cocoa powder. Digging deeper reveals sage brush, menthol and rosemary that evolves and opens with grace over time — a completely entrancing wine.

Incredibly rich and lush, this wine is complex, ridiculously layered, and will age for years to come."

Brewer-Clifton Sta. Rita Hills Pinot Noir 2013,"Sta. Rita Hills, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California",Red Wine,92,"Pomegranate, anise, and Pu-erh tea aromatics set the stage for the flavors of dried cherries, dried wild mushroom and baker's cocoa flavors that follow. Tender and cohesive in the mouth with a very firm and savory palate impression and finish."
Canvasback Red Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon 2012,"Red Mountain, Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,90,"Alluring aromas of blueberry, black cherry, plum and licorice rise from the glass supported by earthy minerality and hints of dry desert sage. While the entry is rich and juicy, the wine reveals its full structure and intensity on the mid-palate, where firm, fine-grained tannins support layers of lush fruit and earth, as well as notes of savory herbs and exotic spices. "
Aveleda Vinho Verde 2011,"Vinho Verde, Portugal",White Wine,90,"A harmonious wine in which the floral aromas of the Loureiro grape variety are merged to perfection with the tropical notes of the Alvarinho. The result is a complex, elegant wine with a long, persistent after-taste in the mouth."

On the nose, the wine is full of cherry and blackberry fruits, which continue on the palate. What sets this Shiraz apart is the intensity of this ripe fruit, which is just as intense on the finish as when the wine first hits your tongue.

Andrew Hardy Little Ox Shiraz 2006,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",Red Wine,90,"The Little Ox is named after wine maker, owner Andrew Hardy, of Hardy family fame. Around 650 cases were made, so based on the previous review of the 2005 and the quality of this, the current 2006 release, it's quite simple, get it while you can. Dense and richly fruited, but light on its feet in relationship to its concentration, this is endowed with finer grained almost powdery tannins and is loaded up with a combination of both red and blue fruit on its medium fuller, fuller frame. Juicy, but dry, with some chewy density on the finish, this is still quite primary and evolving, but everything is in place for big reviews again. Hopefully there will be some around when the tallies come forth. The smart money will place their bets now."

Frederic Esmonin Ruchottes-Chambertin Grand Cru (3 Liter) 2016,"Gevrey-Chambertin, Cote de Nuits, Cote d'Or, Burgundy, France",Red Wine,96,"Ruchottes is a very small Grand Cru, divided into three lieu-dits: Ruchottes du Dessus, Clos des Ruchottes and Ruchottes du Bas, which sits directly above Mazy-Chambertin Haut. The top sections of the Ruchottes are quite steep, with very shallow, and very poor topsoil due to erosion, whereas the lower sections are not quite as infertile. The wines from Ruchottes tend to be characterized as being more structured than other grand crus, but in reality they are finely fruited and more detailed, causing them to appear to be more structured than wines with a heavier fruit profile. The 60 year old vines work their way through the fractured Premeaux and Oolite limestone which lies just beneath the surface. Some Pinot Beurrot in this parcel gives the wine an added measure ofgras, notes Frédéric Esmonin” (Tanzer 2/2016)."
Jordan Chardonnay 2013,"Russian River, Sonoma County, California",White Wine,91,"Classic Russian River fruit at its best. Intense aromas of passion fruit, persimmon and Granny Smith apple leap from the glass, woven with notes of Meyer Lemon, Asian pear and wet stone minerality. A juicy mid-palate of honeydew melon, fresh guava and a touch of baking spice is balanced by firm acidity and a creamy mouthfeel that carries through the lingering finish.

Bodegas Montecillo Gran Reserva 1998,"Rioja, Spain",Red Wine,91,"The very limited production of this wine begins with the careful selection of the best grapes from years in which the harvest is considered to be exceptional.

As air reaches the wine, it's scent completely changes to a citric orange and floral notes that are so characteristic for this unique wine.

Charles & Charles C2 Northridge Vineyard Malbec 2015,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,92,"The inaugural release of our single-vineyard Malbec comes entirely from the Northridge Vineyard which is the highest elevation spot in the Wahluke Slope. We co-fermented a little Cabernet Sauvignon with the Malbec to add some complexity & structure, something that I have experimented with in Argentina over the years & loved the results of. The wine was fermented with native yeast, with limited punch downs & remained on the skins for 50 days. We aged the wine a full 24 months in barrel on its original lees in a mix of 1-3 year old medium toast French oak. We bottled the wine without fining or filtration, leaving the richness & intensity of the wine to speak for itself. With this reductive type of winemaking, when you pull the cork on this wine, it will be encountering oxygen for the first time since it was put in the fermenter late October 2015. This incredibly focused Malbec leads with oodles of black fruit & spice layered over a present yet supple structure & a lingering thread of barrel toast & mocha. The blend this year is 77% Malbec & 23% Cabernet Sauvignon. "
Kingston Family Lucero Syrah 2010,Chile,Red Wine,90,"The 2010 Lucero will benefit from some air. Its aromas and flavors are concentrated, but slow to reveal themselves.

Some Bonarda was blended in for greater complexity and to achieve better balance. Pairs well with a wide range of foods including beef, sausages, spiced or grilled pork, veal, medium-strong cheeses, and meat-based pasta sauces."

However, fine red fruit aromas appear with aeration along with overtones of slightly toasty oak. 2012 Le Clarence de Haut-Brion is full-bodied and powerful with pronounced tannin on the middle palate that tightens up the structure.

Flegenheimer Bros Reserve Red 2010,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",Red Wine,93,"Hammerschlag's McLaren Vale vineyard consists of ironstone and clay over limestone and benefits from cool maritime breezeseach afternoon. Upon securing this location, Hammerschlag got to work in the vineyard selecting 2 clones of Shiraz: 1654,which is very typical of South Australia and Tabhilk, sourced from the oldest winery in Victoria and more reminiscent of thenorthern Rhone.

Critic Robert Parker gave the 2000 Arietta H Block the highest score of any Napa Red Wine in the 2000 vintage. The blend is 50% Cabernet Franc and 50% Merlot.
